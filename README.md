# My_Portfolio
Assignment Project Portfolio by HTML and CSS
# ðŸ’¼ Personal Portfolio - One Page

## ðŸŒŸ Theme / Inspiration
This portfolio was inspired by modern, clean, and elegant web design with a dark theme.  
I used black and deep red colors to create a bold and professional look.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Decisions
- Chose a *single-page layout* to keep everything minimal and user-friendly.
- Used smooth scrolling and section highlights for better user experience.
- Focused on showcasing *projects with images, GitHub links, and descriptions*.
- Included essential sections: About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact.

## ðŸ§— Challenges I Faced
- Adjusting responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Aligning sections properly and keeping layout consistent.
- Choosing color combinations that are stylish but still readable.
